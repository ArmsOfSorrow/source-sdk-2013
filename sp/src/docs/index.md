# Source SDK docs

Welcome! This set of documentation is intended to provide a deeper understanding of the upstream Source SDK 2013 code. Not quite sure yet where this will go...

## Topics of interest

- Networking
- Different parts of the engine/structure of a game (HL2)
    - and how they fit together, i.e. a bunch of DLLs and deps between them
    - client/server/engine etc.
- VPC maybe?
- Really old parts inherited from quake
- Maps
- File formats
- Bugs
- Shaders
- Remnants of console code (PS360)
- Source code directory structure
- [OS dependencies](./dependencies.md)

Let's get started!
